# Bliss Browser OSMode Settings

🌳️🌐️⚙️ The OS mode settings application for the Bliss Browser, enabling browser settings in the operating system mode of the browser.

## Goal

To create a working re-implementation of all [:octocat: `Bliss Browser Settings`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Bliss_Browser_Settings/) within the **OSMode** variant of the browser.

## Languages

This project will be written in Python to retain compatibility with the main settings repository, and because most of the browser is to be written in Python. Some portions will be written in MGears, some will be written in other languages that have not yet been defined.
